## What others are saying

1. ### Rated **5** out of 5  Soft and lightweight



**Tanya**–July 15, 2024





I love this fabric. It is soft, thin, and not stiff, without being see-through. It molds to your body. I wear it as outerwear in warm weather and layered underneath winter clothing. It is slightly prone to stains that you might have difficulty getting out.
