Act as a senior luxury web designer and developer who has worked for brands like Alexander McQueen, Rick Owens, and Off-White. Your mission is to build a premium e-commerce website for a high-end streetwear product.

#Objective:
Build a clean, modern luxury-style website similar to https://www.alexandermcqueen.com/en-ca, but focused on a singular product — a premium EMF-protective hoodie.

#Product Overview:
- A luxury hoodie made from 100% organic cotton and German-engineered Silverell® fabric
- Features EMF-blocking silver fiber weave
- Designed with a minimalist ninja-tech aesthetic
- The product is wearable wellness meets high fashion

#Media & Logo:
- Replace fashion images on Alexander McQueen’s site with the uploaded media files (modeling the hoodie). Treat them as editorial hero shots.
- Generate a clean, modern logo for the brand using the name: *[Insert Brand Name Here]*
    - Use minimalist serif or experimental sans-serif fonts
    - Must convey premium, stealth, and scientific elegance

#Pages to Create:
1. *Home Page*
    - Full-screen landing experience
    - Large hero image from the uploaded media

#Design & UX:
- Mobile-first design
- High-contrast black-and-white palette with soft greys

#Technical:
- Site should be compatible with Webflow or Framer
- Images should be optimized for fast load
- Responsive layout for mobile, tablet, desktop
- E-commerce ready (Shopify integration optional)

#Output:
Export or generate:
